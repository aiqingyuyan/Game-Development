All the models in the game except the cannon is created by me in maya, come from the website: www.tf3dm.com

What's included in the game:

Basic:
Baseic cannon shooting: a cannon base with three cannon(Player can active or deactive each of them)
                        (shooting the enemy is pretty hard, player need to constanly adjust the angle)

Player can also fire Guided Missile which has a cooling down time, once the missile fired, it will automatically find the nearest target and fly toward to it
				
player has a fixed waypoint route around the island

enemy spawn: There are three triggher zone around the island, once player steps into one of them, the zone will spawn enemy ships with a fixed time gap
	     (Max number of enemy ships in zone is 4)
             All enemies will appear to the left side of player
	     The aircraft carrier is just a decoration not enemy, it also has a waypoint route

enemy waypoints: enemys in different zones have different waypoints

Environment:
There are two F-15 strike eagle jet groups constantly flying in the air and dropping bombs to the island

There are also two helicopter groups constantly flying around the island

The F-15 and helicopter groups are decorations used to create a warzone atmosphere

All shooting, bombing, explosions have particle effects (I got them from asset store)

All audios are from freesound.org

UI:
There are some of GUITexts on the scree to indicate the game status (You probably need to click the Maximize on Play button in order to see them)

Camera:
There is a TPS like camera implentmented in the game, so player can focus on the cannon control


Control:
Player press left, right, up, down arrows to control the rotation of cannons
Player press 'F' to fire a Guided Missile


P.S.
Due to time limit and lack of advanced knowledge of unity3d, there are some unfinished features left in the game like real-time terrain deform, buoyancy system, enemy attacks etc.
